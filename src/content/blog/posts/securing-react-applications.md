# Best Practices for Securing React Applications

Security should be a top priority when building React applications. In this post, we'll explore essential security practices that every React developer should implement.

## 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

Always validate and sanitize user input before processing or displaying it. React provides built-in XSS protection, but you should still be careful with:

```javascript
// Bad


// Good
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

```

## 2. Dependency Management

Keep your dependencies up to date and regularly audit them for security vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Check for vulnerable dependencies
npm audit

# Update packages
npm update
```

## 3. Authentication Best Practices

Implement secure authentication using industry standards:

- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Implement proper session management
- Store sensitive data in secure HTTP-only cookies
- Use JWT tokens properly
